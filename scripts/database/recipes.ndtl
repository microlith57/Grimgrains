    & Making tzaziki is easy. This is a basic recipe that works well enough with all kinds of substitutions, depending on dietary restrictions. 
    & {*Substitutions*}
    & It is possible to use {{sunflower seeds}}, cashews and {{tofu}} to replace the hemp seeds. In this recipe, I used half hemp and half soy, because hemp — while being nutritious — is not cheap. Using just {{shelled hemp seeds}} — wallet permitting — is very possible, although you may have to add more water. 
    & If using cashews or sunflower seeds, you should pre-soak them for a few hours prior to blending (discard the soaking water and rinse them well). If using only tofu, you may not require extra water in the recipe.

    & If someone was to ask me which food I could eat forever without stopping, I'd answer chickpeas. There's a TON of different ways to prepare them, and all of these ways are delicious. They can be baked, squished, pureed, ground, sprouted and baked. Their versatility make my life easier, I can eat them everyday and it doesn't ever get boring. 
    & {*Nutrition*}: Legumes is an important part of the diet, and one of the best plant sources of {*lysine*}, one of 9 essential amino acids required for good health. Protein is necessary for muscles, bones, hormones, digestive enzymes, to absorb nutrients and to rebuild cells. If you eat 1/2 cup dry beans a day, your daily protein needs are covered.
    % recipes/spicy.stirfry.chickpeas.3.jpg
    & Another plus is that dry chickpeas keep a long, long time. If you keep them in air-tight containers they will last even longer, because moisture and oxygen is the enemy of all beans. Oxygen makes the bean oils rancid overtime. You can store them for 5+ yrs if you add oxygen absorbers (packet consisting of powdered iron oxide) to the containers. I like to buy them in bulk and cook them as needed. An advantage of buying them dry is that it is cheap, and they taste better (honest).

You'll need to do this repeatedly, until the mixture is broken up into smaller bits and until it has become dry and crisp for {#8-10 minutes or so#}. When cooking, it's important to stir often, and to constantly break it up into smaller bits so all sides can can cook. 
      - NOTE: I like to use a spatula and a fork to break it up, and also to brush some of the batter off the spatula (it is very wet in the beginning and is a bit sticky). Serve into salads, or as a side for other dishes.

Sometimes, if I'm out of peanut butter I'll use tahini instead, the flavour is very similar and doesn't change much in the recipe (also nice for those with peanut allergies). This recipe only works with whole lentils, because there's still a bite to them, halved lentils will soften too much and the resulting texture won't be as pleasant.

  TIME : 20
  SERV : 4 servings
  DESC
    & {*Okonomiyaki*} (meaning, 'grilled as you like it') is a Japanese dish, similar to the American omelette, but the main difference is the variation of ingredients. Typical okonomiyaki are made with eggs, and often include meat or fish, because of this it's not something we would make at home. Making it without meat is simple enough, but without eggs? Back when we lived in Tokyo, our experience in cooking with plants was limited, but now we've been doing it long enough that we can think of alternatives with ease.
    & The key ingredient? {{Chickpea flour}}, or 'besan flour'. We make chickpea pancakes, and {{scrambled chickpeas}} (resembles scrambled eggs) at home all the time. Chickpea flour is a staple on Pino, and works very well for okonomiyaki.
    % recipes/okonomiyaki.1.jpg
    & If you're in a place were nagaimo (or yamaimo) is available, we highly reccommend adding it to the dish. It makes a fluffier pancake. Although we've made okonomiyaki without nagaimo before, so if you can't find it know that it will work and be very delicious anyway. It imparts little flavour, all it does is add nutrition and texture. Nagaimo, unlike most potatoes, can be eaten raw. However, it is best to handle the nagaimo with gloves, or to soak the peeled tuber in a vinegar-water solution to neutralize irritant {*oxalate crystals*} found on their skin. Nagaimo are low-calorie, high in protein, and have potassium, zinc, vitamin C and more. The texture of grated nagaimo can be off-putting, it looks like a regular tuber when whole, but when grated it becomes slime, almost liquid. This sort of texture is well-liked in Japan and referred to as being "neba neba" (slimy); it is present in many other foods like okra and nattou. This texture makes it an ideal egg alternative, it can be used to make deserts when baking. I'm thinking it too, could make a good faux-cheese pizza topping.
    & Aonori is another obscure ingredient - again, it can be omitted, although it tastes really amazing with it. We made okonomiyaki without it when we were in Majuro, because it simply wasn't available, so we used finely cut nori instead. Obviously, this isn't a perfect substitution, because aonori is very sweet and tastes nothing like nori. However, nori is still very delicious and pairs well enough with the okonomiyaki.
    % recipes/okonomiyaki.2.jpg
    & {*How to make true okonomi sauce*}
    & In this recipe, I don't use true 'okonomi sauce'. Why? Because I don't use many pre-made sauces, I prefer to make my own. Okonomi sauce requires many ingredients, and honestly, the sauce I've made works really well in this recipe and makes a good okonomi sauce alternative. If you want to make your own, you can mix {*1 1/2 tbsp sugar, 4 tbsp ketchup*} and {*3 1/3 tbsp worcestershire sauce*}. If you are like me, and don't care to buy pre-made sauces but want to avoid buying both ketchup and worcestershire sauce, you can make these too. To make worcestershire sauce, combine {*apple cider vinegar, water, soy sauce, sugar, mustard powder, onion powder, garlic powder, cinnamon*} and {*black pepper*} in pan, bring to a boil and cook for a minute, then let cool. For {*ketchup*}, using some {*fresh tomato sauce*} may be enough, otherwise, add a bit of {*sugar*} and {*apple cider vinegar*} to it.

  INST
    MAIN
      - Peel the {{nagaimo}}, then soak it in a water and vinegar solution (doing this helps to remove irritants). Dry the nagaimo, then grate {_3 inches_} of {{nagaimo}} (equivalent to 1/4 cup) with a fine grater. Do this over a bowl, as the grated nagaimo is very slimy. Keep aside.
      - Mince {_1 medium_} {{green cabbage}}, keep aside.
      - In a bowl, mix {_1 cup_} of {{chickpea flour}}, {_4 tbsp_} {{nutritional yeast}}, {_1/4 cup_} of grated {{nagaimo}}, the minced {{green cabbage}} and {_1/4 tsp_} of {{salt}}. Then, add {_320 ml_} of {{water}}, or {{shiitake}} dashi. (for shiitake dashi, soak 5-6 shiitake 320 ml of hot water for {#15 minutes#}, or {#overnight#} in cold water.)
      - Heat a non-stick pan at high heat, add {_1 tsp_} of {{sesame oil}}. If you throw some water on and it starts to sizzle, the pan is hot and you can add {_1/4_} of the batter. Alternatively, you can add 1/2, although this makes two very large portions.
      - Let okonomiyaki cook for {#5 minutes#}, shaking the pan every now and then so the batter doesn't stick.
      - After {#5 minutes#}, it's time to give the other side some grilling time. Put a plate on top of the pancake, keep your hand on the plate and flip the pan so that the pancake ends up cooked side up on the plate. Then, slide the pancake back into the pan (cooked side up). You can also just flip it with a spatula, but we rather like the plate method :).
      - Cook for another {#5 minutes#}, then slide onto a plate, repeat process for the rest of the batter.
    SAUCE
      - In a small bowl, mix {_4 tbsp_} of {{soy sauce}}, {_4 tbsp_} of {{mirin}}, {_1 tbsp_} of {{sugar}} and {_1 tbsp_} of {{arrowroot starch}}. Stir well.
      - Heat a pan at high heat, when hot, add sauce and cook for {#2-3 minutes#} until it thickens. Then, divide onto your okonomiyaki.
    TOPPING
      - First, add about {_1 tbsp_} of {{aonori}} on top of the sauce.
      - Then, add {_1 or 2 tbsp_} of {{beni shouga}} (pickled red ginger).
      - Finally, top off with some finely chopped {{scallions}}.

    & {*Seitan*} (say-tan) or {*wheat meat*}, can be made into a variety of meat-like foods using a variation of spices and other seasonings. It is the base of Buddhist vegetarian cooking, and has been documented in China since the 6th century. It's an ingredient that is also present in Japanese cuisine, for {*Shojin Ryori*} (vegetarian cooking) - an important term to remember if you don't eat meat and are traveling the country. Seitan takes on a different name there - it is known as {*Fu*}, and can be found in two forms, raw (nama-fu) or dry-baked (yaki-fu, which looks like bread).
    % recipes/seitan.2.jpg
    & Seitan, or Fu, can be produced at home, but it's very labor intensive. Making it requires kneading wheat flour with water to rinse out the starch from the wheat, what remains is a sticky mass of pure gluten protein. If your plan is to make it from scratch, good on you; but otherwise, gluten flour (or vital wheat gluten) is your best bet. The basic ingredients for seitan are gluten flour and water, but it's best to flavour it with other ingredients - it is rather bland on its own. The amount of liquid that you use to make your dough will also affect the chewiness of your seitan, less waters means more chewy with a harder texture, and more will make it tender.
    & In this recipe, I added chickpea flour for added nutrition. Wheat gluten proteins are deficient in lysine (an essential amino acid for good health), adding a lysine-rich food like chickpea flour to the mix makes up for this deficiency.
    % recipes/seitan.3.jpg
    & When preparing seitan, it's important to flavour both the inside and outside of the dough. Adding a variation of ingredients to the dough mix such as {{ginger}}, {{garlic}}, {{onion powder}}, {{tomato sauce}}, {{soy sauce}} and so on will make it extra flavourful, the same goes for the broth; adding vegetable broth and {{soy sauce}} as a base, and roughly chopped {{onions}}, {{garlic}} and {{ginger}} will season the outside of the dough.
    % recipes/seitan.4.jpg
    & There are {*3 ways*} to cook seitan: {*boiling, steaming or baking*}. In this recipe, I used the boiling method. Steaming requires wrapping the dough in foil or some other wrapper to help it keep its shape, then steaming it in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes or so. Baking the seitan, means flattening or stretching the dough to fit the baking dish, adding seasonings overtop, and baking it for an hour. All methods are good, but some are better for certain kinds of meals.
  INST
    MAIN
      - In a bowl, stir {_1/2 cup_} of {{gluten flour}} with {_1/4 cup_} of {{chickpea flour}}.
      - In another bowl, mix {_1/3 cup_} of {{water}} (or vegetable broth) and {_1 tbsp_} of {{soy sauce}}. Pour into dry ingredients.
      - Knead for {#2-3 minutes#}. If dough is too sticky, add more flour. Let rest for {#10 minutes#}, and knead for another set of {#2-3 minutes#}.
      - {_Separate dough in two_} - optional, but it creates more surface area that can inbibe flavour. Also, the seitan expands quite a bit and having smaller pieces makes it more manageable.
    BROTH
      - Cut the following ingredients into smaller pieces: {_2 cloves_} of {{garlic}}, a {_1/2 large_} {{yellow onion}} and {_1 palm-sized knob_} of {{ginger}}.
      - Add the cut ingredients to a pot, add {_3 cups_} of {{vegetable broth}} (or 1 tbsp of vegetable broth powder in 3 cups of water) and {_2 tbsp_} of {{soy sauce}}. Bring to a boil.

      - Let the seitan simmer for {#1 hour#}.
    HOW TO SERVE

    & Mornings are made better with the nutty and earthy flavour of houjicha oatmeal. If you're not familiar with houjicha, visit a tea shop and ask for it, it's a Japanese roasted tea that is often served with sweet and savoury dishes. It's a good low-caffeine alternative to most teas, and adds just the right amount of flavour to oatmeal without overpowering it.
  INST
    Preparation
      - Boil {_1 cup_} of {{water}}, then infuse {_1 1/2 tsp_} of {{houjicha leaves}} in a tea strainer. You can leave it anywhere from {#1-3 min#}, it depends how strong you like your tea to be. The longer you brew houjicha the nuttier it'll taste.
      - Remove the tea leaves and let cool.
      - Add a chopped {{banana}} (to cut the bitterness of the tea), as well as {_1 tbsp_} of ground {{flax seeds}} (for added nutrition), blend until smooth.
      - Mix in {_1/3 cup_} of {{oats}}, stir well, and then put it in the fridge overnight. Enjoy for breakfast the next day!

NO KNEAD BREAD

  SERV : 1 loaf
  DESC
    & {*No knead bread*} is the easiest kind of artisan-style bread you can make at home - it requires little effort and absolutely no kneading whatsoever.
    & This forgiving recipe allows for substitutions and additions of ingredients without altering the final texture of the bread. If you bake a whole wheat loaf, know that it may not rise as well as one with a mix of {{all purpose flour}}, but you'll still get a rise out of it.
    & The bread can be left to rise overnight. I usually mix it at around 9pm, and bake it early the next morning at 8am. Unlike a lot of bread recipes, there is no second rise, and you don't need to knead or monitor it at all, because the gluten develops on its own. It's a recipe that is very hard to fail at, and you'll get good bread every time!
    % recipes/no.knead.bread.1.jpg
    & We sometimes add spices to the dough, like {{chili|chili pepper flakes}} and {{garlic}}, or we make a more hearty bread by adding {{pumpkin seeds}} or {{sunflower seeds}}. Experiment with it!
    & {*Baking without a dutch oven*}
    & If you don't have a cast-iron container with a lid, you can use a baking pan with foil. This is the method I use, because I lack a good lid. While the bread doesn't have a hard top crust, the result is still great (the bottom will be tougher than the top). Coat the bread pan with {_1 tbsp_} {{olive oil}}, and sprinkle the inside of the pan with {_3-4 tbsp_} of {{cornmeal}} (enough to cover it all in a thin coat). The cornmeal will keep the dough from sticking to the pan. Bread pans don't keep their temperature as well as cast-iron cookware, so the bread will stick due to lack of heat. Oiling the pan is necessary.
  INST
    Preparation
      - In a bowl, mix {_2 cups_} of all purpose flour, {_1 cup_} of {{spelt flour}} (whole wheat works too), {_1 tsp_} of {{salt}}, and {_1/2 tsp_} of {{active dry yeast}}. Mix well.
      - Add {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{water}} gradually, stirring it with a spoon into a cohesive dough. The dough will be wet - that's okay, there is no need to add extra flour.
      - Put a bag or cloth over the bowl, and let the dough rest {#anywhere from 9 to 24 hours#}. Ideally, prepare the dough in the evening and let it rest overnight.
    The Next Morning
      - Preheat your oven to {#450F#}, and add your dutch oven (or ovenproof pot with lid) in it. Pre-heating your container beforehand, will prevent the dough from sticking to the bottom. (To bake {*without a dutch oven*}, I have a mini-tutorial in the recipe description above.)
      - Place the wet dough on a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a rough ball. If too wet to handle, put some flour on your hands.
      - Once the oven is at temperature, carefully take out the dutch oven with oven mitts — careful, it's hot! Place your bread into the dutch oven. At this point, you can add some seeds overtop of the bread. In this recipe, I used {{sesame seeds}}, but {{poppy seeds}} or {{oats}} would also be good. Cover with lid and place back inside oven.
      - Bake for {#30 minutes#}.
      - After {#30 minutes#}, take the lid off, and let it cook uncovered for {#another 7 minutes#}.

I picked up a pack of heirloom carrots at the market last weekend, threw them in the oven with a bit of oil, and served them over a bed of beluga lentils, and topped with a delicious spicy peanut butter sauce!

    & Using oats for bulk is a great, and healthier alternative to flour (plus it's hard to mess up.) Failing at food is the worse. I can never bring myself to throw it away. It feels like a waste to trash it, so what happens is I end up storing it in the back of the fridge. In refrigerators, unlike on school buses, the cool kids don't hang out in the back. After 3 days my anger subsides, and I toss it in the garbage and deny ever making it.

    & Devine has been taking russian classes every week, and he comes back from his lessons with new words to teach me.

    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.1.jpg
    & We made homemade gyoza dough with some friends a few weeks back, and it took FOREVER. Devine had the amazing idea of using our pasta maker to do it. We still needed to do a bit of kneading, to get it through the machine the first time. After that, it's easy and sweat-free!
    % recipes/dark.yaki.gyoza.2.jpg
    & We didn't have any round cookie cutters, the last time we tried I was using upside down glasses. Didn't work well because the rims aren't sharp and smooshes the dough down instead. Again, Devine had a stroke of genius: Cans! I had an empty chickpea pan lying around, it was about the size of a gyoza wrapper so we used that to poke holes through the dough. Genius right?
    & I know not everyone has a pasta maker, you don't need one to make wrappers. You can just use a rolling pin.

While I preferred not to knead by hand, or with a rolling pin, i did do it her way the first time.
  INST
    Dough
      - Mix {_2 cups_} of {{all purpose flour}} with {_1 tsp_} of {{bamboo charcoal powder}} in a bowl.
      - Dissolve {_1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}} in {_1/2 cup_} of {{just-boiled water}}, and pour into the flour little by little while mixing.
      - Knead the dough on a clean flat surface for a few minutes until it becomes smooth. If your dough is too dry, add 1 tbsp of hot water and repeat as needed.
      - {_Separate the dough in 3_}. Roll into balls and wrap them up with a bag or place in a lidded bowl, refrigerate for at least {#30 minutes#}. Leaving it to rest in the refrigerator makes the dough easier to manipulate afterwards.
      - Flatten each piece out with a rolling pin into a rough rectangle, thin enough so that you can run it through the pasta maker. Pass it through your pasta maker a few times, incrementing down to the thinnest setting gradually. You can use a rolling pin instead, it works but it takes a lot more effort. Both techniques work, this one just happens to be quicker and easier on your body. Note that depending on your pasta maker, the dough will come out a bit thicker than a traditional gyoza. If you want it thinner you can flatten it a bit more with a rolling pin.
      - Put the thin sheet of dough onto a clean flat surface. Take a can (with about a 3" diameter) and start to poke holes into it, these are your gyoza wrappers! You can use cookie cutters if you have some. I used an old chickpea can I had.
      - Pile the wrappers, sprinkle some {{cornstarch}} (or potato starch) inbetween each piece so they don't stick together. Put a damp towel over your wrappers so they don't dry out.
      - Repeat this process for the other 2 portions of dough, and you can re-use the scraps and make new dough to run through the pasta maker (no waste~).
    Carrot filling
      - Mix the {_1/2 block_} of {{tofu}}, the {_2/3 cup_} of {{coriander}}, the {_4 grated_} {{carrots}} and the {_2 tsp_} of {{ginger root}} together in a bowl. Add {_2 tbsp_} of {{soy sauce}} as well as {{black pepper}} and {{salt}} to taste. Mix once more.

      - Take 1 wrapper, wet all around the edge with water using your fingers. Keep a bowl of water close to dip your fingers in.
      - Put a spoonful of filling in the middle.
      - Close it. Make little folds with the flap that is facing you using both hands, leaving the back part smooth. Make sure it's sealed tight. Repeat for the rest of the gyoza skins, alternate between fillings. Cover with a damp towel while you work so they don't dry up.
      - Put some vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat. Add gyoza in 2 rows of 3 in the pan. Cook until bottom becomes golden.
      - Add {_1/3 cup_} of {{water}} and put a lid on. Let steam until all the water evaporates.

    & A lot of végé pâté recipes call for whole wheat flour, I've made pâté with it before with great results. If you don't have oats, you can use whole wheat flour instead. Using oats as a substitute works great, I always have a bucket-load of steel-cut oats lying around. To grind the whole oats down into flour, I use my mortar and pestle, but a handstick blender would work well too.

    & I've been looking for ways to incorporate persimmon into savoury recipes. I always thought it could make a great sauce for pasta or rice meals. If puréed, it will taste very sweet, but if you mix in curry powder and other spices and ingredients it becomes less of a dessert.
    & Be careful when selecting your persimmon, there are two varieties. Hachiya persimmon are more elongated and you need to wait for it to soften down before attempting to eat it. Fuyu persimmon, have a tomato-like shape and you can eat it like an apple.
    & There are many different varieties of curry powders it's just a pre-mixed combination of different ground spices. If you're in a hurry, buying a mix is best. But if you have a full stocked spice rack, it may be better and more fun to do it yourself. Typically curry mixes have turmeric, coriander, cumin, black and red bell pepper, cinnamon cloves, fennel seeds, cardamom, ginger and fenugreek. There can be as much as 20 different spices, but you can probably omit a few and it'll still taste pretty great.

That's the case with most of her recipes, most of them have never been written down. That's about to change though, I asked her to make a little booklet for me.
    & I like the idea of having a book of 'mom food', mom food is the best.

    & Introducing, my basic black bread recipe. This bread is super light and fluffy, it's great great for morning toast or sandwiches.
    & I've been reading up a lot about bread, there's so many kinds out there. I wanted to understand how the ingredients we add, can change the texture of the bread. Also read about the differences in temperature, to knead or not to knead etc.
    & Truth is, it depends on the type of bread you want.
    % recipes/basic.black.bread.1.jpg
    & I wanted to make a sandwich bread with a light crumb, the kind that bounces back when touched.
    & The one I made this time has more fat, which in turn makes it softer and fluffier. The fat that you use will also change the texture/taste of the bread. A lot of people wont like the idea of adding 'fat' to a recipe, know that fat isn't synonymous with unhealthy. Too much of it can be bad, but in moderation there really isn't anything to worry about. It also depends on what fat you choose, there are good and bad kinds of fat.
    & There are many things you can do to help soften your bread, like brushing the outside with a little oil or fat. Do this as soon as you take it out of the oven, it will make the outside less crunchy. You can also substitute nut milk for the water, if you want a richer taste. There are so many different things to think about when baking!
    & I made this loaf for a brunch I had with friends, we wanted to have fondue with a set I got as a gift during the holidays. We  cut the loaf into cubes, and dunked them in! Soft bread is perfect for fondue!

    Loaf
      - In a large bowl, stir {_1 1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}} and {_3/4 tbsp_} of {{maple syrup}} in {_1 cup_} of {{warm water}} until dissolved. Sprinkle tsp of {{active dry yeast}}, let sit for {#10 minutes#}.
      - Sift {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{all purpose flour}}, {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{whole grain flour}} and {_1 tsp_} of {{bamboo charcoal powder}} together in a separate bowl. Once flours are mixed evenly enough.
      - Add {_1 tbsp_} of {{canola oil}} to the water mix, then stir in {_1/2 cup_} of the flour mix with a wooden spoon. Keep adding flour a {#1/2 cup#} at a time, until the dough stops sticking to the sides.
      - Put ball of dough on lightly floured counter-top and start kneading, add a bit of flour everytime it starts to stick to your hands. Knead for {#15 minutes#}. You may not use up all of your flour, if there's still a lot left and your dough is nice smooth don't add any more. Don't want to risk drying it out.
      - Heat up oven at the very lowest setting. This will be our warm place for bread rising.
      - Grease up a bowl and put the dough, rolling it once to cover all sides. Cover with a cloth and place in oven. {_Let rise for 45 minutes_}.
      - Your bread should have doubled in size. Take bread out of oven, knead a few times and shape into a 10-11 inch cigar-shape. Sprinkle some {{corn semolina}} on a baking sheet and place bread on top - this will keep it from sticking. Slash the top of the bread in the middle with a knife, doing this will keep the ends of the bread from splitting. Mist top of bread lightly with {{water}}, then add {{white sesame seeds}}. Press lightly to make them stick. Cover loaf with a cloth, put back in oven to rise for an additional {#45 minutes#}. If you don't want a traditional bread shape, put bread in a greased loaf pan to rise.
      - Turn oven up to {#350F#} . Bake for {{30 minutes}}, or until it sounds hollow when tapped at the bottom.
      - Brush sides lightly with {{coconut oil}}, then let cool on a pile of towels or a cooling rack if you have one.
    Burger buns
      - Repeat steps 1 to 6.
      - Instead of forming into a 'cigar' shape at step 7, {_divide into 8 pieces_} and shape into a tight ball. Sprinkle baking sheet with some {{corn semolina}} and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another 45 minutes in the warmed oven.
      - Take buns out of oven, brush lightly with {{vegan butter}} and put {{white sesame seeds}} on top. Bake uncovered for {#20 minutes#} at {#350F#}.
      - Let cool on a pile of towels or cooling rack.
    Hot dog buns
      - Repeat steps 1 to 6. {_Divide through into 15 pieces_} and shape into small cylinders (or general elongated hot dog shape). Sprinkle baking sheet with some {{corn semolina}} and put buns on top. Cover and let rise for another {#45 minutes#} in the warmed oven.

    & Japanese konbini always have a ton of fun flavours for crackers and chips. Anything with shiso, or ume flavoured are insta-buys for me. Stuff like that isn't as available in Montreal, but at least you can find other things like shichimi togarashi!
    & Ume and shiso aren't anything like shichimi togarashi. Originally, i wanted to make senbei but since i recently purchased a bag of chickpea flour, i wanted to have a recipe using that. Senbei is typically made with rice flour and/or rice left-overs. I don't have rice left-overs on hand, we usually just eat it all on the same day. I never make extras.
    & When i decided i was going to make this, i didn't have any shichimi togarashi left, so I made my own! if you have a well-stocked spice rack, you can easily make it yourself. 'Shichimi togarashi' means '7-flavour chili pepper'. If you have some already at home just use that, but if you don't all you need is to grind these spices together -
    & 2 tbsp chili flakes but if you don't all you need is to grind these together - 2 tbsp chili flakes 1 tbsp sanshou (sichuan peppercorns) 1 tbsp roasted orange peel 1 tbsp black sesame seeds 1 tbsp white sesame seeds 2 tsp ground ginger and 2 tbsp nori (or aonori).
    % recipes/shichimi.togarashi.crackers.2.jpg
    & Some people substitute sichuan peppercorns for black peppercorns - I don't reccommend doing that. They're not interchangeable, sichuan peppercorns are what makes it taste awesome. It's a numbing pepper, with a really distinctive taste and aroma. If you eat one peppercorn, you'll notice right away that it numbs your tongue and alters your sense of taste.

      - Proceed to cutting up the ropes into {_2cm sections_}.
      - To make the little lines over the gnocchis (optional, but fun), take each piece and make a ball with it. Press it up against the backside of a fork and slide it down all the way to the ends with your finger. Your ball will be left with sets of lines on top and will take its signature elongated shape.

      - Rehydrate {_1/2 cup_} of {{shiitake mushrooms}} in {_1 cup_} of {{boiling water}}. When shiitake are soft, remove the tails and cut into slices.

Cookies aren't exactly high on the 'health food' scale though, that I know, but it's a way of sneaking in whole grains which can contribute to good health. When it comes to sugar, there are no true 'healthy' alternatives. Desserts are rare treats, and should be eaten in moderation. The same goes for oil. I used canola oil because it imparts little flavor, and because it's a source of {{omega3|#nutrition}}.

    & Burmese tofu is not really tofu, I know, it's confusing. At first, I thought it was tofu blended with turmeric, far from it! Burmese tofu is made with chickpea flour, one of my staple foods. The cool thing about it, is that it takes 10 minutes to make and sets under 1 hour. It's a great soy-free alternative, and the texture is comparable to that of soft tofu.
    % recipes/sweet.mock.eel.nigiri.1.jpg
    & The original recipe for chickpea tofu, I believe, was sourced from a book called {{The Burmese kitchen|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871317680/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0871317680&linkCode=as2&tag=girl07-20}} by Aung Thein.
    & This recipe will use up about half of the burmese tofu, which means you'll have a whole other half to use in other meals.
    & I thought the chickpea tofu would be well-suited as a 'mock unagi kabayaki', and that it would look especially striking atop some black rice.

    & The sauce served over unagi (eel) kabayaki is sweet, with hints of caramel; it's easy to prepare and really makes the dish!
    & Most Japanese sauces are easy to make, and usually require around 3-4 ingredients, these almost always include: soy sauce, sake, mirin, or Japanese rice vinegar. If you want to cook Japanese food, having these around is a must.
  INST
    Rice
      - Prepare {{black glutinous rice}}, it needs to be prepared at a 2:1 water to rice ratio. If you prepare 1 cup of dry rice, you need 2 cups of water.
      - Put {_1 1/2 tbsp_} of {{Japanese rice vinegar}}, {_1 tbsp_} of {{whole cane sugar}} and {_1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}} in a sauce pan. Stir over low heat, until sugar dissolves.
      - Once rice is cooked, transfer to a flat tray, and pour sushi dressing over it. Mix dressing into rice with a spatula, using a sideways cutting motion. Cover with a damp towel, and let cool.
    Unagi sauce
      - Mix {_2 tbsp_} of {{soy sauce}}, {_2 tbsp_} of {{mirin}}, {_1 tbsp_} of {{whole cane sugar}} and {_1 tbsp_} of {{sake}}.
      - Bring to a boil in a pan, lower heat and let thicken for a few minutes.
    Chickpea tofu
      - Bring {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{vegetable bouillon}} to a rolling boil in a pot.
      - Mix {_1 cup_} of {{chickpea flour}} with {_1/4 tsp_} of {{salt}} and {_1/2 tsp_} of {{ground turmeric}}. Add an additional {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{vegetable bouillon}}. Stir until the mixture is lump-free.
      - Lower to medium heat, and pour in chickpea batter. Whisk continuously for {#5-10 minutes#}, until thickened.
      - Pour into a 8x8 baking dish lined with a baking mat. Smooth out top with the back of a spoon.
      - Let cool and set for {#1 hour#}, then refrigerate for a little while longer before cutting. This will give the 'tofu' time to set.
      - After 1 hour, {_cut into 12 pieces_}, and then cut in 2 again lenghtwise to make them fit over nigiri.
      - Preheat oven to {#350F#}.
      - Line backing sheet with a baking mat, line up pieces of chickpea tofu.
      - Bake for {#15 minutes#}. Remove from oven, brush chickpea tofu with unagi sauce and bake for an additional {#15 minutes#}.
    Nigiri
      - Shape tablespoons of black rice into oblongs, smear tops with a bit of {{wasabi}}, lay a nori strip texture-side up, place strip of chickpea tofu as well as the rice ball (wasabi side facing downwards) and finally fold nori over bottom of rice (cut off excess, you can wet the edges with a bit of water if ever it isn't sticking).
      - Makes about {_12 nigiri_}. If you have nigiri molds, shaping the rice into ovals will be very easy. Otherwise use your hands, keep them moist so the rice doesn't stick.

They're ready in an instant, and are delicious when topped with a two-mushroom velouté sauce. This meal is also green on green, most of the ingredients are different shades of the same colour — cool huh?
    & What other green things can I add to this? Wakame! I don't always have fresh greens in my fridge, when I don't, I use wakame. It's handy to have around, it keeps for a long time and doesn't require a lot of prep. Wakame is also a good source of {*Iodine*}, essential for health.

    Preparation
      - Rehydrate {_2 tbsp_} of {{wakame}} in water, drain and set aside.

It's better to rehydrate them overnight, for {#a minimum of 8 hours#}. If you do this, the flavour will be stronger, but if you're in a rush, boiling water is fine. If you have fresh {{shiitake}}, you can also skip this step.
      - Cut {_4 medium-sized_} {{zucchinis}} thinly using a julienne peeler or knife. Place in bowls. I don't always cook my zucchini, but if you prefer a warm version sauté them in a pan.
    Sauce
      - Put {_2 tbsp_} of {{olive oil}} in a saucepan over medium heat, whisk in {_2 tbsp_} of {{all purpose flour}}. Stir until it's completely absorbed by the oil. Let roux cook for a minute or so.
      - Stir in {_2 cups_} of {{vegetable bouillon}}, bring heat up to a boil and then lower to a simmer. Add a {_1/4 cup_} of {{shiitake mushrooms}}, a {_1/4 cup_} of {{shimeji mushrooms}} and a {_1/3 cup_} of {{edamame}} to the sauce.
      - Let cook for {#10 minutes#}.

    & Whenever I ask Devine what he wants to eat, he'll always say pasta. I don't always say yes to this, not unless I want to eat pasta everyday. Second, he'll ask for Pâté Chinois. It's hard for me to say no to that, it's one of my favourite childhood meals, so I succumb, peek into the fridge and see what variation of it I can make. It's a super versatile dish, my recipe has layers consisting of tofu and burmese tofu, green peas, sweet potato and cauliflower.
    % recipes/pate.chinois.1.jpg
    & Pâté Chinois is very much like Shepherd's pie, I'm not sure how it got that name, I've researched it but no one knows its true origins. Quotes from Wikipedia: "...one possible explanation for the Chinese reference is that it was introduced to Canadian railway workers by Chinese cooks during the building of the North American railroads in the late 19th century". I guess we'll never know.
    & My mom made this all the time when I was a kid - she would make the traditional meat version with creamed corn.
    & My meals, as you know, are always meatless, and I now have an aversion to creamed corn, but the spirit of the dish remains. It inspires the same kind of comfort.

    Preparation

    & Black sesame chocolate cookies with a wasabi glaze, it's surprising how well these two things go together.
    & I got the idea from a wasabi-flavoured Lindt chocolate bar. Lindt is a big company, with their products found all over the world, it was surprising to me to see they'd released such a flavour. It's an uncommon pairing. I had some for the first time recently, and was intrigued by it.
    % recipes/wasabi.swirl.chocolate.cookies.1.jpg
    & It's a strange idea. If you're used to having wasabi with sushi, wasabi mixed into anything else is strange. Why would anyone want that in a dessert? Goes to show, that sometimes it's a good idea to play around with flavours. Mixing tastes you like together will not always yield good results, but in this case, it did.
    & I wanted to mix the wasabi directly in the cookies at first, but after reading a lot about baking wasabi, I decided to apply it after in the form of a glaze. The taste fades significantly when heated.
    % recipes/wasabi.swirl.chocolate.cookies.2.jpg
    & It doesn't taste too strong, and like 'Lindt wasabi chocolate bar', it adds just the right amount of kick! It isn't a 'punch-in-the-face', level of strong though, don't worry. I know not everyone likes that.
    & For this recipe, you can use a pre-made yogurt, or you can make your own quick soy yogurt or sour milk. To make it, add apple cider vinegar to soy milk, 1 1/4 tbsp for every 1 1/4 cup of milk.

      - Mix the sesame seeds with {_2 tbsp_} of {{soy yogurt}} and pulse in an immersion blender. Alternatively, you can crush the sesame seeds into a mortar and pestle first, then mix it into the soy yogurt.

      - Take {_1 1/2 cups_} of {{steel cut oats}}, break it down into 'coarse' flour with a mortar and pestle. Don't grind it too finely, having bigger bits gives an interesting texture to the cookie!

    & Fancy it up with some easy-to-prepare mango ice cream with black sesame syrup! Made using only 4 ingredients.
    & Internet is full of recipes using just fruit for ice cream, yep this recipe is one of those. I've made ice cream with other bases, like banana or coconut milk. Both are good dairy-free alternatives. Full fat coconut milk is expensive, so I don't use it too often. You need it to be full fat, otherwise it wont freeze well. I learned it the hard way. Using just 1 fruit is nice because of how little preparation is required. Whether you're using bananas, watermelon, strawberries... all you need to do is cut the fruit up into chunks, and freeze it for a few hours; although depending on the fruit, it may take longer. Also, if like me, you don't have a food processor, you can cut it up into smaller chunks to make it easier to break down with an immersion blender, or your fists, or whatever (it's all good).
    & I like making syrups, or juice reductions a lot. It's simple, and you can use it in many other recipes afterwards! Reductions that aren't sweetened with sugar, you can use as add-on to sauces, or alone as a 'glaze'. My fridge has 3 different syrups in it right now.
    & "What are those?" Devine asks me.
    & "EXPERIMENTS!" I reply, wiggling my digits about in a creepy fashion, "you shall seeeee. Oh yes. You shall seeee."

    & I used a technique by the cook {{Mike Case|https://discoginferno.wordpress.com/tag/sesame-seed-syrup}}, he made a white sesame syrup to use in cocktails. I liked not requiring a blender to make it, blending sesame seeds into a smooth liquid is hard, my immersion blender can't grind seeds finely. Boiling the seeds, and then straining them out is simple. And since you can re-use the seeds afterwards, there's no waste! The fact the seeds are toasted beforehand helps to bring out the nutty flavour, so whatever you do, don't skip that step!
  INST
    Preparation
      - Peel and cut {_1 ripe_} {{mango}} into chunks, lay pieces over a plate lined with parchment paper. Put in the freezer for at least {#2h#}. I put parchment paper because sometimes the fruit will stick too much to the plate and is hard to remove.
      - Put {_1 cup_} of {{black sesame seeds}} in a pan, bring to medium heat and toast them until they start to pop.
      - In a pot, combine {_1 cup_} of {{water}} with the {{black sesame seeds}}. Bring to a boil and let simmer for {#10-15 minutes#}.
      - Strain liquid from sesame seeds using a cheese cloth or with a mesh strainer, squeezing out as much liquid as you can. Reserve sesame seeds for later use.
      - Return liquid to pot, add {_1/2 cup_} of {whole cane sugar}} and bring to medium heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and let cool.
      - Purée frozen mango using an immersion blender, separate in 2 bowls and serve with {_2 tbsp_} of {{black sesame syrup}} and some black sesame seeds reserved from before. Keep the sesame seeds! They're still good, you can use them in other dishes!

    & Summers, goes hand in hand with beer. There is a wide variety of brews here, my corner store has a TON, and most are made locally. Me and Devine like craft beer a lot. To help satisfy our evergrowing craving, I decided to try and make hop flavoured ice cream!
    & Sweet and bitter! SUPER TASTY! Felt like I used just the right amount. This ice cream is definitely for people who love the smell and taste of hops (as well as cold summer dairy-free treats)!
    % recipes/hop.ice.cream.2.jpg
    & I wasn't sure how to 'infuse' the hops into the ice cream base, we tried making hop tea by infusing it overnight in the fridge, but the taste wasn't strong enough. Felt we would get better results and better flavour if the hops were heated. The pouch method worked pretty well, the ice cream base was perfect! Full of delicious bitterness! Devine suggested to make a concentrate with the hops first, and then mix it into the base next time. We tried a batch of hop tea a few days after, adding twice as many hops and it ended up tasting too strong. We'll stick to warm infusions for now.
    & The hops used in this recipe are an American variety called "Colombus". We got them from {{La Choppe a Barrock|http://www.choppeabarrock.com}} on Villeneuve and Coloniale in Montreal. Every time we make home brews, we pick up the ingredients there! You can buy a wide variety of hop buds there, you can even get the pellet kind.
    % recipes/hop.ice.cream.3.jpg
    & It was my second time using the ice cream maker, I got it from the 'Free stuff Montreal' group on facebook. It looks like a little red pail — super cute. The woman I got it from even had the manual! You can make ice cream without a machine, although having one helps with the churning process. It saves a lot of time and effort. If i hadn't gotten that ice cream maker for free, i dont think id have one now, but since it's here might as well use it!
    & If you too, are having too many beers these days, try and cook with hops instead. Same taste, different format!
  INST
    Hop Buds
      - Roughly chop 7 hop buds (may want to use less if you want it less hoppy). Place leaves into the center of a cheese cloth and make a little loose pouch with it, tying the end. Reserve for later.
    Base
      - Shake {_2 cans_} of {{coconut milk}} before opening them, full-fat coconut milk separates over time and shaking will help to mix it up again. Reserve a {_1/2 cup_} of {{coconut milk}} for later, put the rest in a pan with {_1/2 cup_} of {{maple syrup}} and {_1/4 tsp_} of {{salt}}.
      - Bring up to medium-low heat, stir until the {{maple syrup}} has dissolved completely.
      - Stir {_1 1/2 tbsp_} of {{cornstarch}} into the {_1/2 cup_} of {{coconut milk}} that was set aside. When dissolved, pour into the pan with the rest of the coconut milk, while whisking slowly.
      - Increase the heat to medium and add your hop pouch! Let the mixture cook for about {#8 minutes#}. Don't let it come to a boil! Reduce the heat if necessary. Move the pouch around once in a while, pinching it down lightly with a wooden spoon to get some of that nice hop flavour out into your ice cream base.
      - Remove from heat, stir in {_1 tsp_} of {{vanilla extract}}. Leave it to cool — don't remove the hop pouch!
      - When cool, take the pouch out and squeeze out all of the 'hop juice' into the pan using your hands. Mix one last time and pour into a container. Place a sheet of parchment paper over the top so you don't get a skin forming on the surface. Refrigerate for a minimum of {#4 hours#} (or overnight!).
    Ice cream
      - Pull your ice cream out of the fridge. It should have a thick pudding-like texture. Pour into your ice cream maker and churn it to desired consistency (I let it run for {#~23 minutes#}).
      - If you don't have an ice cream maker, please refer to any these {{6 methods|http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-ice-cream-without-an-ice-cream-machine-171060}} from the Kitchn.
      - Transfer to a container and press a sheet of parchment paper over the top to keep ice crystals from forming. Your ice cream should be ready to eat in {#5 hours#} or so! If you want harder ice cream wait until the next day to eat it. Enjoy!

    & Using veggies as noodles in a dish, is something I really enjoy doing. It tastes fresh, and is ready in a second! Thank you julienne peeler, your precense in my kitchen has made the process of cutting vegetables in thin strips enjoyable. Spending an evening cutting daikon or cucumbers thinly by hand, are now nothing but a distant memory. Brought home a bag full of beautiful heirloom carrots last weekend, I've been using them in meals all week. Heirloom carrots come in a wide variety of colours. The yellow ones, I thought, resembled pasta. Thus came the idea for heirloom carrot pasta!
    & I used yellow and red carrots for this recipe, love how these veggies are coloured all the way down to the core. Zucchinis make great pasta noodles, but the white interior makes for a dull-looking meal. It looks especially beautiful with a sunflower "cheese" sauce. As you know, I'm allergic to tree nuts so my vegan cheese alternatives are somewhat limited. Luckily, I can have seeds which can be used interchangeably with nuts in most pasta sauce recipes. It produces a similar result, just as creamy and just as nutritious!
    & Until recently, I didn't know why you had to soak seeds and nuts before eating them. As it turns out, they have their own personal defense mechanisms. Nutritional inhibitors and toxic substances. Ingesting seeds, or nuts, without soaking, makes it harder to digest, you're also missing out on a ton of nutritional benefits. The last time I made this recipe, I tried the quick boiling method. It is easier to grind down into a sauce, but it will still be hard on your digestive system. My stomach groaned for hours after that meal, I personally prefer to soak the seeds overnight.

    Preparation
      - Dissolve {_1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}} in {_1/2 cup_} of {{water}}. Add {_1/4 cup_} of {{sunflower seeds}}, cover with a breathable material and leave to soak overnight or for at least {#8 hours#}. Alternatively, you can pour boiling water over the seeds and let them soak for {#10 minutes#}. This method is quicker but it will be less nutritious.
      - Sautee {_1 chopped_} {{yellow onion}} and {_2 minced_} {{garlic cloves}} in a pan with {_1 tsp_} of {{olive oil}}. Cook until onion is translucent.

      - Peel and cut {_4 large_} {{heirloom carrots}} into thin strips, using a julienne peeler or a knife. The goal is to make pasta-like strips.
      - Add a bit of water to a pot, bring to a boil. Place steamer basket in the pot, cover and steam the carrots for a minute. You don't have to steam your carrots, but personally I like to do it so they're not as stiff.

    & The rice was seasoned with miso for added flavour, and was filled with carrot 'kinpira' — 'Kinpira' means "sauteed" (usually with a mixture of mirin soy sauce and chili peppers.) It's a sweet and spicy dish that is often served in bentos.

The places I tried are all within walking distance, because generally when I want ice cream i don't want to have to go far to get it. Luckily, the 2 places that are near my home offer dairy-free options, though often this means sorbet. While I like sorbet, the flavors are rarely as creative as milk-based ice creams. When I don't want sorbet, I just make my own ice cream at home. I have many other ice cream recipes on this blog, but some of them require a bit more waiting time and effort, which admittedly I don't always care for. Banana ice cream to the rescue! A delicious and simple alternative to dairy or coconut based desserts.

It was summer, we wanted to cool our insides — Tokyo summers are unbearably warm. I can't say I remember where I got the idea to put balsamic vinegar on ice cream, it might have been in a magazine or a restaurant. That evening, it came to mind, and we tested it out. It was fantastic! Not things I thought could go well together.

While you wait for them to harden up, you can prepare your balsamic coulis and make your appartment reek of vinegar - yay! If you've ever boiled balsamic vinegar, you know what I'm talking about. I didn't want to pour the vinegar straight from the bottle over the ice cream, making a reduction makes it thick and syrupy, and it just works better as a topping.
    & I don't have a powerful blender or food processor at home, so reducing the 2 frozen banana chunks to a smooth purée was difficult. It took longer than i thought it would, and because of that my ice cream was melting when the time came to take photos. So pro-tip, don't use an immersion blender. If you're desperate and/or reckless and want to try it anyways, do it in batches.

    & Cadbury released a vegemite chocolate bar, I liked the idea so much, I decided to make something inspired from it. I ended up making some vegemite caramel.
    & I currently have two vegemite jars, a gift from a friend in Australia. It's delicious, but I don't always know what to make with it. It's great on toast, but aside from that — mind goes blank.

    & The vegemite caramel mix of the Cadbury bar intrigued me. Vegemite is very salty, but I happen to be a big fan of salted sweets — I'm looking at you sea salt chocolate. If I added some to date caramel (instead of salt) I knew it would taste good. I used deglet noor dates for this recipe (because it's what I had). Feel free to use medjool dates instead. Medjool dates are great, but you don't have to use them. They're expensive, and their cheaper counterpart works just fine.
    & I was right, it tastes amazing. Cut a few apples up, and dip them right into the vegemite caramel! You can also spread it over some toast! This is a weird mix, but believe me, it tastes awesome.

      - Stir {_1/2 cup_} of {{all purpose flour}}, {_1/2 cup_} of {{spelt flour}} and {_1/2 tsp_} of {{baking powder}} together in a bowl.
      - Put the steamed pumpkin, the {_4 tbsp_} of melted {{canola oil}} as well as the {_1/2 cup_} of {{coconut sugar}} in another bowl. Mash the {{pumpkin}} with a fork (or use a hand blender) and stir everything together until smooth and well mixed.
      - Add the wet to the dry ingredients, mix with a wooden spoon until you get a soft and consistent dough. It will be sticky but that's fine, if it's too sticky feel free to add a bit of extra flour. Let the dough rest for {#10 minutes#}.
      - Line a baking sheet with a baking mat. Make little balls of dough, as round as you can make them, and flatten each one gently. Bake for {#15 minutes#}.
      - Decorate each cookie with {_3_} {{pumpkin seeds}}, sticking them at the top (pointy end in).

    & Got up early sunday morning with cookies on my mind. When I peeked into my fridge, I spotted a lonely jar of leftover date caramel. I decided to make some salted caramel cookies with unsweetened carob chips!
    & The kind people at {{Daybreak mill|http://www.daybreakmill.com}} sent me a bag of einkorn flour last week, I'd never heard of it before. Einkorn was one of the first domesticated and cultivated plants. It has a higher percentage of protein than regular wheat, with high levels of fat, phosphorus, potassium, pyridoxine (a form of vitamin b6) and beta-carotene. Another great thing about it, is that it isn't as toxic to people on gluten-free diets. This wasn't proven, but it's worth looking into!

    & I tried baking bread with it this week, it did not rise all that well. While it is a dense loaf, the texture is quite nice! It has a strong nutty taste, making it more flavorful than regular wheat. Einkorn bread is filling, I don't think I would use it to make a sandwich but it makes nice breakfast toast.
    & After my bread experiment, I decided to try and make something sweet. The dates, coconut sugar and carob chips create a strong caramel taste. The fleur de sel sprinkled overtop brings out the flavor nicely.
    & I can't thank Daybreak mill enough for sending me this gift, and for introducing me to einkorn flour! Their products are grown with the utmost care. You can get your own einkorn flour from their website, they also have a ton of other great products. Encouraging companies that share your outlook on food and life is important.

For instance in the west, people use ketchup as a condiment, but the Japanese use it as a base for tomato sauces.

Nowadays, you can find spaghetti seasoned with soy sauce, and served with seaweed.

    & {*About arame*}: {{Arame}} is a species of kelp of a dark brown color, it has a mild, semi-sweet flavor and a firm texture. It can be reconstituted in about 5 minutes, and can be added to many kinds of dishes. It is high in calcium, iodine, iron, magnesium and vitamin A. 
    & NOTE: This recipe used to include {{hijiki}} seaweed, but because even small amounts can contain inorganic arsenic that exceeds the tolerable daily intake for this substance, I have decided to subsitute it for arame. It doesn't change the recipe much, and it is a healthier alternative.

In this chapter, the authot talks about the many ways to make fresh bread while sailing, including a quickbread recipe that uses 3 basic ingredients: flour, sugar and beer.
    & Beer bread you say? Right up my alley! The next day I gave it a try, the result is fantastic — surprising given the little effort it takes to make it.
    & The best thing about this bread, is that it can taste different everytime. Using different beer, will change the taste and color of the bread. I tried baking with an IPA (21st amendment), a Hefeweizen (Sunriver brewing co) and a brown ale (Hobgoblin).
    & If you have self-rising flour, you can omit the baking powder and salt. You can use even less ingredients if you have a craft beer that has live yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. If you have a beer like that only flour, sugar and beer will do. Have fun experimenting with beers in your bread!

It's just as well, because others we met who had tried, came back empty-handed. In the Marquesas, most vegetables are brought in by supply ships; you can never be certain of what you're going to get.

    & While Devine & I lived in British Columbia, I remember one morning waking up to the sound of knocking on our boat, it was our neighbours, coming to offer some homemade pan-fried corn pone. It was delicious, and all to simple to prepare... just some cornmeal, water, salt and a bit of oil.
    & I'd never had corn pone before, nor did I ever think of making any sort of flat cake using corn as a base. After that, I started to make it myself and would serve it with chili - lazy cornbread, as I like to call it. & While sitting in the Niue yatch club, I found an old vegetarian cookbook. I must have spent an hour reading through it, the recipes were fantastic, the title read "The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook". It was sitting there, amongst a panoply of writing, including a Polish Murakami book (how I wish it had been written in English). The cookbook had an entire section dedicated to cooking with corn. It's in there that I found a recipe for masa dumplings.
    & Masa is corn that is simmered and ground into a paste. It's the base for many recipes, you can make Mexican-style tortillas with it, that, or you can use it to make dumplings! I don't have access to fresh corn, nor do I have the space or the time to make my own masa, but I used polenta ({{corn semolina}}) instead and it worked! The only difference is that you need to add boiling water so you can roll the mixture into balls. If you were to use masa, you wouldn't need the added moisture. 
    & The texture of the dumplings is fun and chewy. The outside is soft, but the inside is like that of dense cornbread. 
    {*Recommendations*}
    & Devine & I enjoy eating it with tomato sauce or with a spicy apricot sauce. Instead of apricot jam, you can add apricot juice to the mix (orange will taste wonderful too). I added jam because I didn't have any juice on the boat, and besides, it works well in this recipe. 
    & Adding extra spices, like cumin, chili flakes and turmeric will add a nice flavour to the dumpling mix.

    Preparation
      - Mix {_1 cup_} {{corn semolina}}, {_1/4 cup_} {{all purpose flour}}, {_1/2 tsp_} {{baking soda}}, {_1 tsp_} {{baking powder}}, and {_1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}}. Stir until well mixed.
      - Bring {_1 cup_} of {{water}} to a boil, pour into dry ingredients and mix well. When the dough is wet and sticky, form {*1/2" balls*} with your hands. You can make larger or smaller balls - note that cooking time will change if the diameter is bigger.
      - Bring a big pot of water to a boil, add corn balls and boil for {#10-15 minutes#}.
      - Drain, let cool.

      - Mix all sauce ingredients together (all, except the arrowroot starch).
      - Put {_1 tsp_} of {{arrowroot starch}} in a bowl, and dissolve in {_1/4 cup_} of {{water}}. Set aside.
      - Pour sauce into a pan, and bring to medium heat. Once the sauce starts to boil, add a few spoonfuls of the arrowroot starch mix to thicken the sauce. Once thickened, divide corn dumplings into bowls and pour sauce overtop.

    % recipes/breadfruit.gnocchi.1.jpg
    & Breadfruit has a taste and texture that resembles that of {{potato}}. And so, it only makes sense that it too, can be made into gnocchi. The flesh of the fruit can be kneaded easily, especially if the fruit is very ripe. I have tried to knead it when half-ripe, it works too, but requires added moisture and more kneading - not to mention that it doesn't have as much flavor. Ripe breadfruit develops a sweet taste, it can be difficult to catch it at the right moment, like avocados, sometimes it'll overripen overnight and be rendered uneatable. Because we like it so much, we've bought many and have had time to better tell when it can be eaten. The outside becomes very soft to the touch, but only just.
    & We serve these with a light sauce, to better taste the gnocchi. A sauce that we enjoy, is minced garlic and chili peppers cooked in olive oil. The sauce is poured overtop and sprinkled with bits of shredded nori.
    & If you happen by the south pacific and see a {{breadfruit|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrZ5h0j8jTo}}, make some gnocchi. It's worth the effort.

      - Remove foil, peel skin away, cut in half, and remove the seed.
      - Let cool, and mash with your hands into a cohesive dough. Add {{flour}}, {_1/4 cup_} at a time, until the {{breadfruit}} flesh stops sticking to your fingers. You may need more, or less, depending on the size of your fruit.
      - Sprinkle your work surface with {{flour}}, take a golf-sized ball of dough, and roll it into a thin, finger-sized log. Cut the log into bite-sized pieces (around 2cm long) and repeat for the rest of the dough.

    & We have arrived in New Zealand, the land of plenty. All of the foods that we like and miss are here. Foods like nutritional yeast, miso and soba (to name a few). With a fully re-stocked pantry, I started to make faux-cheese again, a recipe from Vegan Richa that is simple to make and that I love. The recipe is for a cheese that can be cut into wedges, or that can be grated over pizza. I had an idea to use this recipe to make filling for ravioli, the difference being that I won't add any agar agar (a seaweed based powder that makes liquids jellify). Making your own dough is simple, the whole process will take you less than 40 minutes.

    & I got the idea to make ravioli from an old 70's book about the cooking of Italy. This book is one of many that we found in a thrift shop here in Whangarei; we bought all the ones that we could find. Devine & I like picking through them, drawing inspiration from the images and ingredients.

    & A lot of the recipes in these books use meat and dairy, but it's easy to swap these ingredients out for something else. In New Zealand, the groceries are plentiful and finding everything we need is a breeze. We hope you enjoy this recipe, and that you try and make {{Richa's original pepper jack cheese recipe|http://www.veganricha.com/2014/08/almond-milk-pepper-jack-cheese-vegan-glutenfree-recipe.html}} too.
  INST
    Preparation
      - For the filling, mix all of the dry ingredients into a bowl, then add all the wet ones (including the chopped {{spinach}}) and stir well until evenly mixed.
      - Heat a pan at medium heat, pour the filling into it. The mixture will thicken. When it does, transfer it back to a bowl and keep it aside for later.
      - To make the dough, mix {_1/2 tsp_} of {{salt}} with {_1 cup_} of {{all purpose flour}}. Add {_2/3 cup_} of water, knead the dough on a floured surface, working in extra flour if the dough is too sticky. Once you have a smooth ball of dough, wrap it up and let it rest for at least {#10 minutes#}.
      - Divide the dough into two pieces, and roll out the first half of the dough to make it as thin as possible — and as rectangular as possible. Roll out the second piece of dough into a similar size and thickess.
      - On the first sheet of pasta, place a mound of filling of the faux-cheese and spinach mixture every 2 inches across and down the pasta (spaced out to look like a checker board).
      - Dip your finger into a bowl of water, and make a line inbetween each row of filling (the water acts as a bond to hold the ravioli together).
      - Place the second sheet of rolled-out pasta on top of the first one, pressing down firmly around the filling and along the wetted lines.
      - With a knife (or ravioli cutter, if you feel fancy), cut the pasta into squares along the wetted lines. Keep separated pieces of ravioli aside.
      - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and add the ravioli. Stir them gently to keep them from sticking to another another or on the bottom of the pot. Cook for {#7-8 minutes#} or until fork tender.
      - Serve with a light sauce, we made one with {{chilis pepper flakes}}, fresh {{basil}} and {{olive oil}}. A light tomato sauce would also be delicious.

    & Yes, another {{breadfruit}} recipe - I'm that obssessed. This fruit is one of the most versatile ingredients I've ever cooked with, it's cheap and it pairs well with just about anything. When we returned to the south pacific last june, you can be sure that the first thing we went looking for at the market was this lovely green wonder. It's become a staple for us, a treat and food we are excited to cook and eat.
    & While in a grocery store in Fiji, we spotted breadfruit flour! A company called {*{{Friend's Fiji style|http://friendfiji.com}}*} sells it in bags of 300g, it's good alternative if the fresh kind can't be found. It's something we'll stock up on when we leave, so we continue to have breadfruit in our diet (in some form).

    & Making pasta from scratch requires your hands, a knife and a rolling pin (or bottle - whatever works). Making pasta that is even and thin by hand is a challenge, it's easier to opt for thicker 'udon-style' noodles. Expert soba chefs in Japan can cut noodles thinly by hand, but this requires experienced hands. We have a good blade, but lack the patience as well as the desire to cut even noodles - we're very okay with imperfect noodles.

      - Separate dough in two, put one half aside. Separating the dough makes it easier to roll if you have limited counter space (like I do).
      - Sprinkle flour on your working surface, flatten the ball out from the center to the outer edge. Continue to roll, flipping the dough over once or twice and dusting it with flour to prevent it sticking. Roll to desired thickness.
      - Fold the sheet of dough into a flat roll, then cut into it cross-wise into 0.5cm strips.
      - Repeat all the steps for the other half of the dough.
      - Carefully unroll each coil with your fingers, then transfer to a floured surface.

The vegetables in Majuro are imported from either Guam, or Hawaii by cargo ship, and because they spend much time at sea they are frozen. Freezing fresh whole vegetables is never a good idea, the vegetables are usually rotten even before they make it onto the shelves. When possible, we opt for local produce. Majuro has little fresh vegetables, but they do have some fruit and among these, is {*the pandanus fruit*}.

    & Pandanus, or {{Pandanus tectorius|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus_tectorius}}, bears a fruit that look like a giant pinecone, it is made up of little wedge-like phalanges, commonly referred to as 'keys'. Each fruit has about 40-80 keys, the part of the keys that is attached to the core is soft, and a bright orange colour. In the Marshall Islands, people suck on the orange part which is sweet and tastes of cane sugar. The soft part can also be cut, and processed into juice. It is possible to make the juice yourself, this {*{{blog post|http://www.cuisinivity.com/globalfeast/pacific/Marshall_Islands/2012/Pandanus.php}}*} explains the process at length.
    & I don't have the space, nor the tools to prepare pandanus juice, but a store in Majuro sells frozen bags of purée. This is what I used to prepare this pandanus fruit cake, and the topping that goes with it. What does it taste like? It is similar to mango, sweet, but also bitter.
    % recipes/pandanus.fruit.bread.1.jpg
    & I bought a generous portion of frozen pandanus purée, and couldn't use most of it in the bread so I used the rest to make a topping. The topping is optional, but very, very delicious and I recommend it. The chia seeds don't act as a thickener and can be omitted, but they add nutritional value to the meal.
    & If you ever come across some pandanus fruit, please try it! Making pandanus juice from scratch requires some muscle and serious dedication, but in places where it grows, chances are you'll also find a 'processed' version.

    & We always try our hardest to buy as few packaged foods as we can, and if we do buy pre-made goods, we aim for glass. This, too, isn't always possible.
    & We ran out of mustard the other day, and couldn't find any at the store that wasn't packaged in plastic. We decided then that it was better to make our own. It requires few ingredients, little time to prepare (25min for prep, few days for soaking), and is inexpensive.
    & How do you do you start? First, you have to find raw mustard seeds. You can choose between yellow, brown and black seeds; these affect the 'heat' of the mustard. A dark seed imparts more flavour than the lighter variety, and is what we used in this recipe. The seeds are then soaked in a mixture of water and {{apple cider vinegar}}, although you can also use beer and white wine as a base. The water should be room temperature or cold, because using hot liquids denatures the enzymes that create the 'heat' in mustard.
    & We don't have {{tools}} onboard that require electricity, so to grind and crush seeds and herbs we use a {*heavy ceramic mortar and pestle*}.
    & After the mustard has been ground, it can stored in a glass jar at room temperature. Because of its antibacterial properties, mustard {*does not require refrigeration*} - another plus!
    % recipes/mustard.from.seed.1.jpg
    & The best thing about making it yourself is that you can vary the quantities and base ingredients according to your personal preferences. If you don't like having a strong vinegar taste, you can lessen the amount of apple cider vinegar and add more water instead. You can also add spices and sweeteners. For traditional 'yellow mustard', all you need to do is add turmeric (for color) and a sweetener - the possibilities are endless. Give it a shot - it's cheap, fun and there's no plastic involved!

      - If you've got a blender or food processor, purée the seeds until smooth. Otherwise, add a small quantity of seeds in your mortar and grind them down with your pestle. Repeat until the seeds are crushed and puréed - the mixture doesn't need to be perfectly smooth.

It's in everyone's best interest to know how things are made - there are no downsides to knowing, and in a bind it's a useful skill, but not just this - making your own produces less waste (packaging) and you control what you ingest (less salt, sugar etc). What's great about a basic recipe is that you can swap ingredients with little consequence (most times) and you can add to it to suit your needs and cravings.
